## Overview

### Purpose

After a natural disaster strikes, communities are often left with the enormous clean-up effort required to restore people's homes, businesses and community areas. During these times government, council and emergency services resources are often stretched thin. **App Name** aims to help communities better coordinate the clean up process after a natural disaster, or any time that community members would like to coordinate group action for the betterment of their community. 

**App Name** has been designed and built by Chris Hullman and Mick Caffery as their final cap-stone project for Coder Academy’s Full Stack Development Bootcamp, 2022.

## Project Management

#### Setup

In the beginning, we discussed how we should effectively manage the project and the tools we should use. We aimed to incorporate different tools and methods from Agile Project Management frameworks like Scrum and Kanban that would suit our team size, project scope and timeframe. 

##### ***Timeframe***

We were given a timeframe of five weeks to complete both Part A and Part B of the assignment, starting on Wednesday 19th of October 2022 until the final due date of Wednesday 23rd of November 2022. The contact hours throughout the Bootcamp were Monday to Wednesday, 9 am to 5 pm. We chose to keep this as the core contact hours for the project. Due to team members' work commitments and job search efforts, we decided that any additional hours from Thursday to Sunday would be planned ahead.

##### ***Kanban Board***

We decided to use Trello to manage our Kanban board as we both had experience with this product. We used the Kanban board to create a backlog of tasks or user stories that would be required to move the project forward. Then move each item into an “in progress” section while being worked on, then finally move the item to the “done” section once complete. As a team, we both took responsibility for organising the backlog and communicating to each which items were being updated. 

##### ***Scrum Sprints & Ceremonies***

We decided to break the 5-week period into five sprints based on the Scrum framework. We would use these sprints to plan and build our product in a series of five iterations, which would help break down the final product into manageable pieces of work. We predict that this approach will help us ship our work sooner and more frequently, whilst giving us the opportunity to adapt and change as we receive feedback from user testing. 

###### Planning Meetings

We decided that each sprint would start each Wednesday and begin with the planning ceremony (meeting). Each planning meeting addressed the following three questions:

**What is the main sprint goal and the value that would bring to the project?**

**Which items can be moved from the backlog to achieve this goal?**

**How should we break down the chosen items into daily increments?**

Elaborating on these topics we would discuss what we would like to achieve during the sprint and the value that would bring to the project. We then moved items from the product backlog that were necessary to complete the sprint, and delegated how we would complete these items. Finally each of the items moved from the backlog was broken down into an increment that would be achievable to be completed in one day.

To help with tracking the tasks in each week's sprint we used a Gantt chart. The Gantt chart we used was a Trello power-up created by TeamGantt which made it easy to move Kanban cards in the backlog into each sprint’s Gantt chart. 

###### Daily Standups

The purpose of our teams morning standup was to discuss the progress towards the sprint goal and adapt the backlog as necessary. As we were a small team of just two, on top of our morning stand-up (during core days) we were in frequent communication throughout the day discussing any challenges or re-evaluating the daily plan. 

##### Sprint Reviews

The purpose of our sprint reviews is to review what was accomplished during the Sprint, adjust the product backlog, and determine future adaptations. 

#### Sprint 1

##### Planning meeting 1

We kicked off the project with an initial planning meeting. This is where we discussed potential ideas and submitted our chosen idea for approval. We then discussed how we would like to manage the project and which tools and methods would suit. We then talked about the initial tasks that we both would work on. 

The Kanban board below was created after this initial planning meeting and reflects these initial tasks and backlog. We decided that we should place an emphasis on revising the MERN masterclass presented by our class instructors on the previous two days, as the concepts covered were crucial to our team performing well on this assignment.

Due to the first day of the project starting on Wednesday, and the core contact hours for the project being Monday to Wednesday we decided that we would hold another planning meeting on Monday.
