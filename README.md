## Overview

### Purpose

After a natural disaster strikes, communities are often left with the enormous clean-up effort required to restore people's homes, businesses and community areas. During these times government, council and emergency services resources are often stretched thin. **App Name** aims to help communities better coordinate the clean up process after a natural disaster, or any time that community members would like to coordinate group action for the betterment of their community. 

**App Name** has been designed and built by Chris Hullman and Mick Caffery as their final cap-stone project for Coder Academy’s Full Stack Development Bootcamp, 2022.

#### Setup

On day one of this assignment, we discussed how we should effectively manage the project and the tools we should use. We aimed to incorporate different tools and methods from Agile Project Management frameworks like Scrum and Kanban that would suit our team size, project scope and timeframe. 

We decided to use Trello to manage our Kanban board as we both had experience with this product. We used the Kanban board to create a backlog of tasks or user stories that would be required to move the project forward. Then move each item into an “in progress” section while being worked on, then finally move the item to the “done” section once complete. As a team, we both took responsibility for organising the backlog and communicating to each which items were being updated. 

We were given a timeframe of five weeks to complete both Part A and Part B of the assignment, starting on Wednesday 19th of October 2022 until the final due date of Wednesday 23rd of November 2022. We decided to break the 5-week period into five sprints based on the Scrum framework. We would use these sprints to plan and build our product in a series of five iterations, which would help break down the final product into manageable pieces of work. We predict that this approach will help us ship our work sooner and more frequently, whilst giving us the opportunity to adapt and change as we receive feedback from user testing. 

We decided that each sprint would start each Wednesday and begin with the planning ceremony (meeting). At the start of each planning meeting would review the backlog. Following this, we would discuss what we would like to accomplish during the sprint and then move tasks and stories from the backlog to the current sprint. To help with tracking the tasks in each weeks sprint we used a Gantt chart. The Gantt chart we used was a Trello power-up created by TeamGantt which made it easy to move Kanban cards in the backlog into each sprint’s Gantt chart. 

As we were a small team of just two, on top of our morning stand up we were in frequent communication throughout the day discussing any challenges or re-evaluating the daily plan. Also due to our small team size, the sprint review was incorporated into the following week’s sprint planning meeting. Each of the five sprint reviews are detailed below.
